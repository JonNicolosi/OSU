1. True

2. False

3. False. In a for/if/else statement, even if the if and else clauses 
are both satisfied during multiple iterations, it doesn't mean that
every possibility within the if or the else statement is satisfied.
The goal in statment/line coverage with a a simple if statment 
is to cover every node of the graph. However, in branch coverage, 
you must cover all the nodes AND all the edges.

4. True. If you cover every edge, then you must have also covered
every node. 

5. False. Path coverage differs from branch coverage in that not 
only do you have to check every node and every edge, but every 
combination of every node and every edge leading to the termination
of a given block of code. There are exponentially more outcomes to 
check.

6. I expected to have higher branch coverage but I understand why
I did not. However, I was expecting high line coverage and the test
did reveal high line coverage. During my testing, my intention was
to prioritize the search for errors rather than test for basic
functionality. Therefore, the tests I designed skipped over many
branches.

7. A test suite written using only input domain partitioning 
would likely fair worse in a coverage evaluation when compared to
a test suite written to optimize coverage metrics. IDP prioritizes
those domains of input which are most relevant. This may result in 
poor branch coverage because many inputs are not being tested and 
therefore many branches are not being taken.
