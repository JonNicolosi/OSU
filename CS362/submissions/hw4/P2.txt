1. This means that only once branch is being covered. 
In the case of a for/if, it means that we've only covered
the scenario in which each iteration evaluates to true in the
if statement.

2. Interfaces are N/A because all the methods in an
interface are abstract. This means the methods contain no
implementation. In other words, there is nothing to test.

3. testBasicFunctionality may run through only the most
predictable scenarios. Tests should be designed to try to
break individual components to simulate extraordinary
circumstances.

4. As the number if/else if/else statements increases, the
number of branches to be covered increases exponentially.
