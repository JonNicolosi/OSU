I believe the bug lies within the logic of discardCard.
The method discardCard relies on the remove method of the
ArrayList class. The remove method shifts all elements to the 
left after it removes the specified element from the 
specified position.

The bug does not surface if you consistently remove cards from the
top of the deck (i.e. the last element of the CardCollection 
ArrayList).

Neither will the bug be noticed if a card is picked from the middle.
The rest of the cards will be shifted in place and the order of the 
cards will be preserved.

However, if you remove a card from the middle of the CardCollection
and then attempt to add it back, it must be appended to the back of
the CardCollection. We are not provided a method that will allow
us to reinsert the card in the spot that we removed it from.
